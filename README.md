# Learning Programming Languages

This repository contains practice code, exercises and small experiments created while learning or improving skills in multiple programming languages.
The goal is to strengthen foundational knowledge, explore language-specific features and develop a deeper understanding of software engineering principles.

## 🚀 Purpose

This repository exists to:

- Build practical experience across multiple languages
- Improve problem-solving and code structure
- Track learning progress over time
- Maintain a clean, organized collection of training exercises
- Explore new technologies and reinforce existing knowledge

---

## 🧩 Languages Covered

- **C++**
- **Java**
- **C#**
- **Python** (review & intermediate topics)

Each language has its own folder with dedicated exercises, notes, and examples.
